## Accessibility Testing

### 1. Before Customization (Default Library Behavior)

| Test                          | Result                             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Tab navigation to buttons     | Not focusable                      |
| Enter key to activate buttons | No button behavior                 |
| Arrow keys to move slides     | Not working                        |
| Screen reader announces slide | Only "button" or image, no context |
| Active slide indication       | Not visually different             |
| Pause/Play control            | Not available                      |

1.The tab is not switching between left and right button
2.Enter button is not moving slide left or right when the enter button is clicked.
3.NVDA test

- No proper reading of previous and next button when navigation to next slide on tab click.
- No proper reading of prev and next button when hover over button or navigate with tab.

| Feature                                                  | Status |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Buttons use semantic `<button>` with `aria-label`s       | ‚úÖ     |
| Arrow keys move between slides                           | ‚úÖ     |
| Active slide shows visual indicator (border)             | ‚úÖ     |
| Screen reader announces current slide and image alt text | ‚úÖ     |
| Pause/Play toggle with correct labels                    | ‚úÖ     |

## existing issue with NVDA

- The left and right arrow functionality on browser works fine but when NVDA tries to read the arrow press on prev/next buttons it is not working as expected.I found that it is existing issue with NVDA application itself.
